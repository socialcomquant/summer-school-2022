TW Half of my body systems have shut down now, I decided I'll be that bitch who just wont die. The devil hasn't cut my life string yet 💪 need to slowly make my comeback and say🖕to this horrible anorexia disease. A reminder that you dont need to be 20kg to be dying from it 💁‍♀️	1219263403652456448
So I just got off an 11hr flight and the woman across the aisle from me was wearing a T-shirt with I WANT ANOREXIA written across it. Why does God continue to test me?	1219216520875778049
I smashed my scale that I had through the majority of my time before recovering from anorexia!! I cut you out of my life, bitch!!	1219113396718706688
I'm a19 yo female I've been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. There isn't any eating disorder centers in Sudan Psychiatrists are with little to no expert regarding this category And CVS complications that showed lately put me at a higher risk of sudden heart stop. Help please	1223620731063410690
@XSkeletonGirlX Yeah,,,,, i have literally no expectations of neurotypicals to understand,,, anorexia is such a well known disorder so its still baffling that many people are blissfully unaware 🙄 maybe my perspective is skewed since ive always been obsessed with psychology tho	1217356802553151488
The NHS saved my life when I was dying from my anorexia and now I get to wake up every morning, pull on my scrubs and give back to the people who gave me back my life #mynhs	1229127288178036738
2018 - Now..  anorexia is a serious thing to recover from. i was depressed and was on medications that caused me to lose more weight.. 2019 i met people, began to travel, eat heaps of new food and go to the gym. i became healthy.  i was 28kg in the first pic and now i’m 48kg 🥳💜 https://t.co/DUdNXgJKcO	1218500955911720960
