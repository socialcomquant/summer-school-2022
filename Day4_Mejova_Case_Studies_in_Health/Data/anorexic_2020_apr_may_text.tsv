call me stupid but i’ve always been told you can’t have anorexia and bulimia ???? surely it would just be anorexia with binge purge subtype ?	1250520646142083084

I blocked you because you have not only participated in vile, false, conversations about me, but have falsely accused me of faking my anorexia, which almost killed me last year. I haven’t even released the screenshots of you defending Amberlynn, calling me a bully.  Get fucked. https://t.co/3I1kf5u13H	1251776805528371200
‘fat people cant have anorexia’ is so dumb; ru only diagnosable with an ed once you’ve put your body through literal hell? the thoughts aren’t enough? that’s like saying ‘sorry, can’t diagnose you with anxiety cos i’ve never seen you have a panic attack’	1256717947864666112
non ed accounts will be blocked, so will proana and anyone asking for tips or anything like that. this is NOT a proana page &amp; i do not want to see proana content.	1258923603392897024

Someone could look like the lady to the left and have anorexia nervosa and the lady to the right could have a bing eating disorder. Eating disorders are never this clear cut you guys.	1247480788863631361
Every time I think about your intense “concern” over a fat person’s health, I laugh.  Because when I was dying of anorexia &amp; starving myself, I received nothing but praise.   So tell me again, about this “health” you speak of?  Bec it sounds to me like an excuse to hate fat ppl	1251255701193863171
